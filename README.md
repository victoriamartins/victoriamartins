### Hello, I'm Victória! 

👩‍💻 I'm a Computer Science student and I'm working on my second undergraduate research project about Machine Learning.

🎮 I like to play video games, listen to music and watch TV shows in my free time.

📚 I've been studying Machine Learning for over a year and I'm trying to develop my first personal project using Python.
