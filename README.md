### Hey, I'm Victória! 

👩‍💻 I'm almost graduating in Computer Science, and I worked on two undergraduate research projects about Machine Learning during graduation.

🔍 As my final assignment, I made a prototype of a mobile application for fine motor skill improvement after a UX research process. You can check it [here at Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/lT8J78eEVur6jFRCSmFTRE/tcc-2.0?node-id=0%3A1&t=qbzoDa7vsbfdLWij-1).

🎮 I like to play video games, listen to music and watch TV shows.

📚 I've been studying Front-End development after a two-year gap to get my first job, and I store all my projects here.
